The Agave API: a Science-as-a-service Platform
==============================================

For any field of science where more than a single computer is needed to perform calucations or store data, researchers must decide what tools and resources they will use to scale up calculations, manage data, capture metadata, share results, and collaborate.  The Agave API provides a powerful toolkit for connecting up compute and data resources, sharing and publishing results, capturing provenance and reproducibility information, and scaling up as needed.  It lets you do things like:

- give reviewers of your paper a way to reproduce your work with a few clicks
- share working data with individual collaborators by giving them a web link
- build apps and interfaces so others in your lab can launch jobs from their browser
- publish your own scripts and software and create community portals
- swap between remote compute clusters and cloud resources, without getting bogged down in the details

This material demonstrates many of the capabilities of the Agave platform in a one-day format.  It assumes some familiarity with with either working at the command-line or writing scripts, but nothing more.
